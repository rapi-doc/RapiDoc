        Endpoint to create and initiate a pipeline. 

        ### Paragraph
        In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a **nasty**, _dirty_, `wet` hole, filled with the ends
        of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to
        eat: it was a [hobbit-hole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hobbit#Lifestyle "Hobbit lifestyles"), and that means comfort.

        ### Use HTML in markdown
        <br>
        <div style="color: white; background-color:SlateBlue; padding: 12px; border-radius:2px">
          Markdown do not support colors or fancy HTML designs. However, if you need you can put some html directly inside the markup with some inline styling.
          This box I designed using raw HTML inside the markdown
        </div>  
        <br>
        <div style="color:#bbb; background-color:#444; padding: 12px 0px 12px 12px;border-left: 5px solid #F06560;">
          <b style="color:#F06560">TIP</b>  Here is another one, done using HTML inside markdown with two different colors to make it appear like a TIP
        </div>
