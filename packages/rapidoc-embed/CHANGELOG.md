# @rapidoc/embed

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- 5c535eb: The option `path` is now `uiPath` (and `publicPath` is `publicUiPath`), so its name says which path it is: the URL path the reference page is served at. The old names still work. The integration contract is version 2. `rapidocSidebar` of `@rapidoc/vitepress` takes one options object, `{ spec, uiPath, methods, collapsed }`; the form `(spec, link, options)` still works.

### Patch Changes

- 5c535eb: The API sections of Starlight and VitePress sidebars now show each operation's HTTP method (GET, POST, DEL) in RapiDoc's colours and strike deprecated operations through; the Starlight "deprecated" badge is replaced by that mark. `@rapidoc/vitepress` also escapes tag and operation names from the spec, which VitePress writes as HTML. `@rapidoc/embed` adds the shared helpers as `@rapidoc/embed/sidebar`. The `methods` option (`sidebar.methods` in Starlight) picks the style: `as-colored-text` (default), `as-plain-text`, `as-colored-block`, or `false` for none.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- 4aaf108: `@rapidoc/embed` adds `createResponder(options, { readAsset })`: it matches a request against the routes and returns the status, headers and body, so a server integration only passes the request in and the response out. `@rapidoc/hono` now runs on it, with no change in behaviour.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 5a1e064: `rapidoc` now publishes metadata for tools and integrations in `dist/`: TypeScript types (`rapidoc`, `rapidoc/react`, `rapidoc/vue`), a JSON Schema of every attribute (`rapidoc/options.schema.json`), a Custom Elements Manifest, `oauth-receiver.html`, and `integration.json` with the SRI hash of each file. New package `@rapidoc/embed`: the shared core for RapiDoc plugins (frameworks, docs sites, tools), which renders the standard host page for `<rapi-doc>` and comes with conformance fixtures for ports in other languages.
