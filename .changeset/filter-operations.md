`<rapi-doc>` and `<rapi-doc-mini>` choose which operations to show with one attribute, `filter-operations`, replacing `match-paths`, `match-type` and `remove-endpoints-with-badge-label-as` (removed). Terms are operationIds, `GET /path`, paths, `*` / `**` path globs, `tag:`, `badge:` and `deprecated`, with `!` to leave out; shown operations keep the order of the first term they match. Matching is exact: a v12 `match-paths` prefix becomes a glob (`/pet/**`). `@rapidoc/prerender` takes `filterOperations` in place of `matchPaths`, `matchType` and `removeEndpointsWithBadgeLabelAs`, and the portal's `{% api-operation %}` tag uses `filter-operations`. See the v12 to v13 migration guide.
